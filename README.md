# movie-prototype
git repository for the movies prototype


I think we need to look over the file and check it to the requirement to see how we can improve the mock up

And anything else we can add or improve on.

In the rubrics it give the areas on which we are marked on, we can look at it and see where we can improve to get higher marks.

I think we may need to look over it again to check it before doing the prototype

let set a time to check it over...
